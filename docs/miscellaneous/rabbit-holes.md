## Summaries

### Occult Practice w/ Gnomesky

As it turns out, occult rituals are not about sacricficing goats, or cursing annoying coworkers.
While the occult is often associated with the supernatural and evil, the reality is that Occult rituals have uses similar to meditation and mindfulness.
Helping people work through personal issues, trauma, and fostering personal growth and enlightment.
